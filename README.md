# Git commit message

Knowbl uses a git commit message convention that helps us read fast and also is parsable by toolchains.

We agree on a short list of leading active verbs:

* Add = Create a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.

* Cut = Remove a capability e.g. feature, test, dependency.

* Fix = Fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.

* Bump = Increase the version of something e.g. dependency.

* Make = Change the build process, or tooling, or infra.

* Start = Begin doing something; e.g. create a feature flag.

* Stop = End doing something; e.g. remove a feature flag.

* Refactor = A code change that MUST be just a refactoring.

* Reformat = Refactor of formatting, e.g. omit whitespace.

* Optimise = Refactor of performance, e.g. speed up code.

* Document = Refactor of documentation, e.g. help files.
